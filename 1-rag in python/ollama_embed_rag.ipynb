An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.\\n\\nIn a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.\\n\\nDeep Learning - Geeksforgeeks\\nScope of Deep Learning\\n\\nToday Deep learning AI has become one of the most popular and visible areas of machine learning, due to its success in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and Reinforcement learning.\\n\\nDeep learning AI can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.\\n\\nSupervised Machine Learning: Supervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to make predictions or classify data based on the labeled datasets. Here we input both input features along with the target variables. the neural network learns to make predictions based on the cost or error that comes from the difference between the predicted and the actual target, this process is known as backpropagation.  Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional neural networks, Recurrent neural networks are used for many supervised tasks like image classifications and recognization, sentiment analysis, language translations, etc.\\nUnsupervised Machine Learning: Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to discover the patterns or to cluster the dataset based on unlabeled datasets. Here there are no target variables. while the machine has to self-determined the hidden patterns or relationships within the datasets. Deep learning algorithms like autoencoders and generative models are used for unsupervised tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.\\nReinforcement  Machine Learning: Reinforcement  Machine Learning is the machine learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.\\nArtificial neural networks\\nArtificial neural networks are built on the principles of the structure and operation of human neurons. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. An artificial neural networkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s input layer, which is the first layer, receives input from external sources and passes it on to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. Each neuron in the hidden layer gets information from the neurons in the previous layer, computes the weighted total, and then transfers it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted, which means that the impacts of the inputs from the preceding layer are more or less optimized by giving each input a distinct weight. These weights are then adjusted during the training process to enhance the performance of the model.\\n\\nFully Connected Artificial Neural Network - Geeksforgeeks\\nFully Connected Artificial Neural Network\\n\\nArtificial neurons, also known as units, are found in artificial neural networks. The whole Artificial Neural Network is composed of these artificial neurons, which are arranged in a series of layers. The complexities of neural networks will depend on the complexities of the underlying patterns in the dataset whether a layer has a dozen units or millions of units.  Commonly, Artificial Neural Network has an input layer, an output layer as well as hidden layers. The input layer receives data from the outside world which the neural network needs to analyze or learn about.\\n\\nIn a fully connected artificial neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. Then, after passing through one or more hidden layers, this data is transformed into valuable data for the output layer. Finally, the output layer provides an output in the form of an artificial neural networkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s response to the data that comes in. \\n\\nUnits are linked to one another from one layer to another in the bulk of neural networks. Each of these links has weights that control how much one unit influences another. The neural network learns more and more about the data as it moves from one unit to another, ultimately producing an output from the output layer. \\n\\nDifference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning :\\nmachine learning and deep learning AI both are subsets of artificial intelligence but there are many similarities and differences between them.\\n\\nMachine Learning\\n\\nDeep Learning\\n\\nApply statistical algorithms to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\tUses artificial neural network architecture to learn the hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset.\\nCan work on the smaller amount of dataset\\tRequires the larger volume of dataset compared to machine learning\\nBetter for the low-label task.\\tBetter for complex task like image processing, natural language processing, etc.\\nTakes less time to train the model.\\tTakes more time to train the model.\\nA model is created by relevant features which are manually extracted from images to detect an object in the image.\\tRelevant features are automatically extracted from images. It is an end-to-end learning process.\\nLess complex and easy to interpret the result.\\tMore complex, it works like the black box interpretations of the result are not easy.\\nIt can work on the CPU or requires less computing power as compared to deep learning.\\tIt requires a high-performance computer with GPU.\\nTypes of neural networks\\nDeep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\\n\\nFeedforward neural networks (FNNs) are the simplest type of ANN, with a linear flow of information through the network. FNNs have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.\\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specifically for image and video recognition tasks. CNNs are able to automatically learn features from the images, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.\\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that is able to process sequential data, such as time series and natural language. RNNs are able to maintain an internal state that captures information about the previous inputs, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and language translation.\\nDeep Learning Applications:\\nThe main applications of deep learning AI can be divided into computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning. \\n\\n1.
